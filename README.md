VibeCoding Assignment: Build a Mini E-Learning Platform
Objective:

Apply the concepts learned in the Week 1 VibeCoding session by building a small e-learning platform prototype. This assignment encourages combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally a backend, while leveraging AI-assisted coding to speed up development.


Project Brief:

Create a mini e-learning platform that allows learners to:

View a list of courses (at least 3).

See course details when clicked.

Mark a course as “completed”.

Optionally, include user login or sign-up functionality.

The focus is on building a functional prototype, not a full production-ready system. 

Sample VibeCoding Prompt for AI Assistance:

“Hi AI, I want to build a mini e-learning platform. It should have a home page with a list of courses, a course detail page showing lessons and progress, and a button to mark each course as completed. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Make it visually simple but clean. Include hover effects for buttons. The course data can be stored in a JavaScript array or JSON object. Provide the complete code for the prototype.”
